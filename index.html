                            Hi Everyone! <br><br> My academic engagement at California State University, Long Beach has helped me gain knowledge of essential computer programming languages, such as Python and C++, that I can learn and apply to real-world situations. In addition, I have independently studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through LinkedIn Learning and Cerritos College courses to be versatile, prepared, and ready to take the lead on what is to be asked of me. <br><br> I believe that I am willing to step up to the challenge in order to learn and apply what I have previously studied for a company that focuses on both marketing and web development to give customers the best experience they can’t get anywhere else. In addition, I have studied Japanese for 5 years and have earned the California State Seal of Biliteracy in Japanese. 
                            <br><br>
                            My experience at Amazon Fresh includes originally being a dedicated and reliable retail store associate where I learned to receive, stock/stow, and be an in-store shopper for Amazon members who place online orders. After a few months of employment, I was promoted to the role of a certified training ambassador/dock associate for my Amazon Fresh store because of my excellent communication, leadership, and work ethic skills that helped me become a good role model for all of my fellow colleagues. 
                            <br><br>
                            My personal skills include outstanding organizational, multi-tasking, time management, and computer-oriented skills that can be put to the test. In addition, I am a detail-oriented driven individual that believes that teamwork and a great collaborative environment is the best way to ensure that our best work is put forward and that everything is done professionally in a timely manner. 
                            <br><br>
                            Beyond my educational career, I have done independent projects that help to showcase my skills in HTML and CSS which can be seen through my GitHub account located on my attached resume including an eResume, REVCharge, MetaLens, and other mock websites that were created from other platforms, WordPress and SquareSpace.                         </div>

                                    <p>As of October 21, 2022, I was officially promoted to become a dock associate at Amazon Fresh. Under
                                        this role, I am now one of the few certified dock associates in which I am given access to receiving
                                        purchase orders, transshipments, and vendor merchandise inventory without the assistance nor
                                        supervision of my zone lead superiors.
                                        <br><br>
                                        As the primary receiving assistant for the zone leads, in the case that no leadership individual comes
                                        in during that particular day, I am given a key fob where it gives me exclusive access to my store's
                                        computer where the data and receiving technologies are located in order to take on the roles and
                                        responsibilities as a zone lead.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In addition to being the head receiver, I am also held responsible for virtually and physical viewing
                                        and editing any vendor merchandise inventory that has been received to the store on and off of my
                                        shift. This includes ensuring that the virtual quantity count matches the physical unit quantity that was
                                        received as well as ensuring that the vendors arrive on time and dock-checking them into the system to
                                        make sure that the product gets to the floor in a timely manner without delays in order to provide both
                                        efficiency and product quantity reassurance.</p>

                                        Under this role, I am the new employee's mentor and help to point them in the right direction to not only
                                        follow the rules but also to help them execute their jobs to the best of their abilities.
                                        <br><br>
                                        As the main assistant for the zone leads, I am put in charge of many tasks that they would do in case
                                        they were absent during that time. This includes dock checking in the pallets, virtually receiving any
                                        P.O.'s, transshipment, and VMI shipments that come into the store. Lastly, they trust me to be the zone
                                        lead on point in case they are absent for a long period of time and no superior is watching over the
                                        department at the time.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In addition, I answer any questions and provide guidance to the new Amazon Fresh associates in order
                                        to provide them the confidence they need to exceptionally. After the end of their shifts, I perform daily
                                        audits on the new employees to check their progress and suggest areas of improvement.
